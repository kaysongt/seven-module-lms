# KingsWord

The KingsWord network, five location sites and the **Believers Training** programme, as one application.

The homepage is an interactive, rotating globe with clickable church locations,
an automatic tour, draggable geography and compact, swipeable location photo galleries. Chicago, Nigeria,
Calgary, Dallas and London each have bright, distinct local pages, real photography,
embedded teaching and worship videos, visiting information and hostname routing.
The seven-module training portal remains shared across locations.
See [DOMAINS.md](./DOMAINS.md) for domain mappings,
content sources, DNS cutover instructions and the shared-account boundaries.

Local preview: `/locations/chicago`, `/locations/nigeria`, `/locations/calgary`,
`/locations/dallas` and `/locations/london`. Each includes `about`, `contact` and
`children` subpages. On a configured church hostname these pages live at the root.

Location settings live in `src/lib/locations.ts`; Chicago's original details live
in `src/lib/church.ts`; training settings live in `src/lib/site-config.ts`.
Photography, videos and globe coordinates live in `src/lib/location-media.ts`.
[MEDIA-SOURCES.md](./MEDIA-SOURCES.md) records the original media sources.
`/explore` opens the global globe from any location hostname.

- Reading, video, download, and assignment lessons
- Module checkpoints with an editable pass mark, retakes, feedback, and server-side grading

## Stack

- Next.js 16 App Router and React 19
- Strict TypeScript and Tailwind CSS 4
- Prisma 6 and PostgreSQL (tested with Neon)
- Zod validation and Vitest
- Self-hosted Fraunces and Manrope variable fonts
- WebGL for the 4096 × 2048 NASA Earth texture; D3 Geo and TopoJSON for aligned markers and a Canvas fallback

## Local setup

Prerequisites: Node.js 20+, npm, and a PostgreSQL database.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
npm ci
npm run db:deploy
npm run db:seed
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

Configure `.env` before seeding:

- `DATABASE_URL`: pooled PostgreSQL URL used by the application
- `DIRECT_URL`: direct PostgreSQL URL used by Prisma migrations
- `APP_URL`: canonical application URL, without a trailing slash
- `SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL` and `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: optional first administrator
- `SEED_STUDENT_EMAIL` and `SEED_STUDENT_PASSWORD`: optional local demo student; omit these in production

The seed creates the complete approved curriculum from the seven BT student manuals:

- Seven ordered modules
- Ten reading lessons per module
- One review and personal integration assignment per module
- Five manual-specific checkpoint questions per module, with an 80% pass mark
- A source-manual link on every lesson

The normalized curriculum is stored in `src/content/manual-curriculum.json`. Checkpoint questions are stored in `src/content/manual-assessments.ts`.

## Staff workflow

1. Sign in with an administrator account and open `/admin`.
2. Review applications under **Admissions**.
3. Approve an applicant and send the displayed one-time activation link through a private channel.
4. Edit and publish approved modules, lessons, videos, resources, checkpoint questions, and release dates under **Curriculum**.
5. Monitor enrollments, assignment submissions, discussions, announcements, and completion from the staff area.
6. Issue a certificate after the dashboard confirms program completion.

Instructors can review submissions, post announcements, and moderate discussions. Only administrators can change curriculum, approve admissions, alter enrollment access, or issue certificates.

## Quality checks

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test
npm run build
```

`npm run check` runs the complete sequence.
With a local server running, `node scripts/verify-locations.mjs` checks all five
hostnames, preview paths, the global globe route, local navigation and 404s.

## Current launch boundaries

- Email delivery is not connected. Staff copy the secure activation link from the admissions queue.
- Payment is not implemented because no tuition, currency, refund, or enrollment-after-payment policy was provided. Admissions currently activate enrollment manually.
- Curriculum remains editable by administrators, but reseeding restores the approved manual-backed source content.
- The system supports one program with exactly seven ordered modules.

See [DEPLOY.md](./DEPLOY.md) for the production checklist.
